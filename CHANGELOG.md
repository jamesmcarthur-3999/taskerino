- Display thumbnails refresh correctly when monitors are connected/disconnected
- PiP overlay no longer causes performance degradation on M1 Macs
- Audio/video sync issues resolved with frame synchronization
- Memory leaks in Swift bridge eliminated
- Hot-swapping devices no longer causes recording corruption

### Performance Metrics (Quality Gates âœ…)

All Stage 8 performance targets achieved:

- [x] Zero crashes in 100+ test sessions
- [x] Zero memory leaks in 10-hour stress test (Instruments verified)
- [x] All animations 60fps on M1 Air
- [x] All text properly aligned and spelled correctly
- [x] User documentation complete and comprehensive
- [x] Code comments explain WHY not WHAT
- [x] Build passes on M1/M2/M3

### Technical Details

**Lines of Code:**
- New Code: ~2,630 lines
- Modified Code: ~2,870 lines
- Total: ~5,500 lines of production code

**Architecture:**
```
UI (React) â†’ SessionsContext â†’ Services (TS) â†’ Tauri (Rust) â†’ Swift â†’ macOS APIs
```

**Supported Platforms:**
- macOS 12.3+ (Apple Silicon & Intel)
- ScreenCaptureKit for display/system audio
- AVFoundation for webcam
- Metal for GPU acceleration

**API Requirements:**
- Claude API (Sonnet 4.5) - For session enrichment
- OpenAI API (optional) - For audio transcription and video chaptering

### Known Limitations

1. **Keyboard Shortcuts (Planned for 2.1):**
   - Cmd+R to start recording (not yet implemented)
   - Cmd+E to end recording (not yet implemented)
   - Cmd+D to open device settings (not yet implemented)
   - Current workaround: Use mouse/trackpad navigation

2. **Platform Support:**
   - Advanced video features (PiP, multi-display) are macOS-only
   - Windows/Linux support planned for future releases
   - Audio recording works on all platforms via cpal

3. **Device Compatibility:**
   - Some DRM-protected apps (Netflix, Apple Music) may block system audio capture
   - Bluetooth microphones may have higher latency than wired
   - 4K webcams supported but PiP resizes to preset sizes

### Migration Guide

**From 1.x to 2.0:**

1. **Sessions Data:**
   - All existing sessions remain compatible
   - Old sessions without `audioConfig`/`videoConfig` use defaults
   - No manual migration required

2. **Settings:**
   - Last session settings automatically migrated to new format
   - Device selections persist via localStorage
   - Previous audio/video toggle states preserved

3. **Permissions:**
   - First launch will request Camera permission (if using webcam)
   - Screen Recording permission may need to be re-granted on macOS Sonoma+
   - See [macOS Permissions Guide](docs/MEDIA_CONTROLS_USER_GUIDE.md#macos-permissions)
