## What Was Built

### 1. Enhanced Type System (`canvas/types.ts`)

**Action Interface** - Expanded from generic to structured:
- Added dedicated fields for each action type:
  - `createTask` - Full task specifications (title, description, priority, tags, dueDate, etc.)
  - `updateTask` - Task updates with reasoning
  - `createNote` - Full note specifications
  - `updateNote` - Note updates with reasoning
  - `linkToTask` / `linkToNote` - Links to existing items with relevance
  - `batch` - Grouped actions
- Added `metadata` for AI reasoning, confidence scores, and screenshot references

**New Component Types:**
- `ActionCard` - Rich preview with inline editing
- `ActionGroup` - Grouped actions with batch execution
- `RelatedItemsPanel` - Existing items with suggested updates
- `ActionReviewDashboard` - Bulk action management

**Props Interfaces:**
- `ActionCardProps` - Expanded action display
- `ActionGroupProps` - Batch operation control
- `RelatedItemsPanelProps` - Related items display
- `RelatedItem` - Type-safe item representation
- `ActionReviewDashboardProps` - Bulk management interface

### 2. New Canvas Primitives (4 Components)

- **Error Handling:** Try-catch with user notifications
- **Integration:** Wraps TasksContext, NotesContext, UIContext

**Usage:**
```tsx
const execution = useActionExecution();
await execution.createTask({ title, description, priority, tags });
execution.showNotification({ type: 'success', title: 'Task Created', message });
```

### 4. AI Integration Updates

#### **aiCanvasGenerator.ts**
**Changes:**
- Added imports: `FlexibleSessionSummary`, `SummarySection`, `isFlexibleSummary`
- Updated `designCanvas()` signature to accept both `SessionSummary` and `FlexibleSessionSummary`
- Extracts sections from flexible summaries: `const sections = isFlexibleSummary(summary) ? summary.sections : []`
- Passes sections to prompt builder: `buildComponentCanvasPrompt(..., sections)`

#### **aiCanvasPromptV2.ts**
**Three Major Updates:**

**1. Function Signature:**
```typescript
export function buildComponentCanvasPrompt(
  c: EnrichedSessionCharacteristics,
  session: Session,
  summary?: SessionSummary | FlexibleSessionSummary,
  sections?: SummarySection[]  // NEW
): string
```

**2. Summary Sections Data Block:**
Added `<summary_sections>` XML block that includes:
- **Recommended Tasks:** Title, priority, context, category, duration, screenshots
- **Related Context:**
  - Related tasks with ID, title, relevance, status, priority, screenshots
  - Related notes with ID, summary, relevance, tags, screenshots
  - Duplicate prevention data (tasks NOT to suggest with reasoning)

**3. Component Schemas & Action Guidelines:**
- Added schemas for ActionCard, ActionGroup, RelatedItemsPanel, ActionReviewDashboard
- Added comprehensive action generation guidelines
- Included complete examples:
  - Creating tasks with full specifications
  - Updating existing tasks/notes
  - Proper JSON structure with metadata and reasoning

**Example from prompt:**
```json
{
  "component": "ActionCard",
  "props": {
    "action": {
      "type": "create_task",
      "label": "Write OAuth Integration Tests",
      "createTask": {
        "title": "Write comprehensive tests for OAuth 2.0 flow",
        "description": "...",
        "priority": "high",
        "tags": ["testing", "oauth"],
        "sourceSessionId": "{{session.id}}",
        "relatedScreenshotIds": ["ss-15", "ss-16"]
      },
      "metadata": {
        "reasoning": "Session completed OAuth implementation but no tests exist",
        "confidence": 0.95
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Component Renderer Updates

#### **ComponentRenderer.tsx**
**Changes:**
- Added imports for new components: `ActionCard`, `ActionGroup`, `RelatedItemsPanel`, `ActionReviewDashboard`
- Updated `COMPONENT_REGISTRY` to route new component types
- No direct context injection (handled by ActionExecutionProvider wrapper)

#### **CanvasView.tsx**
**Changes:**
- Added import: `ActionExecutionProvider`
- Wrapped `ComponentRenderer` with `ActionExecutionProvider`:
```tsx
<ActionExecutionProvider>
  <CanvasNavigationProvider onNavigateToSource={...}>
    <ComponentRenderer tree={canvasSpec.componentTree} />
  </CanvasNavigationProvider>
</ActionExecutionProvider>
```

### 6. CanvasButton Updates

#### **CanvasButton.tsx**
**Changes:**
- Added `useActionExecution()` hook
- Added local loading state: `const [isExecuting, setIsExecuting] = useState(false)`
- **Replaced all `console.log` placeholders** with real execution:
  - `create_task` → `execution.createTask(...)`
  - `update_task` → `execution.updateTask(...)`
  - `create_note` → `execution.createNote(...)`
  - `update_note` → `execution.updateNote(...)`
- Added success/error notifications
- Added try-catch error handling
- Loading indicators during execution

## Data Flow

### End-to-End Flow

```
1. Session Ends
   ↓
2. AI Enrichment (sessionSynthesis.ts)
   - discoverRelatedContext() finds related tasks/notes
   - generateFlexibleSummary() creates summary with sections:
     * RecommendedTasksSection (tasks to create)
     * RelatedContextSection (existing items + updates)
   ↓
3. Canvas Generation (aiCanvasGenerator.ts)
   - Extracts sections from FlexibleSessionSummary
   - Passes sections to AI prompt
   ↓
4. AI Generates Canvas (via buildComponentCanvasPrompt)
   - Sees RECOMMENDED TASKS → creates ActionCard/ActionGroup components
   - Sees RELATED CONTEXT → creates RelatedItemsPanel
   - Includes full action specifications
   ↓
5. Canvas Rendering (CanvasView → ComponentRenderer)
   - ActionExecutionProvider wraps tree
   - Components rendered with action handlers injected
   ↓
6. User Interaction
   - User clicks action card "Create Task" button
   - ActionCard calls execution.createTask(...)
   ↓
7. Task/Note Creation
   - ActionExecutionContext → TasksContext.createManualTask()
   - Storage persists item
   - UI shows success notification
```

### Context Architecture

```
CanvasView (provides ActionExecutionProvider)
  ↓
ActionExecutionProvider (wraps TasksContext, NotesContext, UIContext)
  ↓
ComponentRenderer (renders component tree)
  ↓
ActionCard / ActionGroup / RelatedItemsPanel / CanvasButton
  ↓
useActionExecution() hook
  ↓
execution.createTask() / execution.updateTask() / etc.
```

## What Makes This Different

### Before (Read-Only Summary):
```
Session → AI Summary → Canvas Display
                          ↓
                    User reads achievements
                    User manually creates tasks
                    User manually updates notes
```

### After (Action-Oriented):
```
Session → AI Summary → Canvas with Actions
                          ↓
                    ActionCard with "Create Task" button
                    ActionCard with "Update Note" button
                    RelatedItemsPanel with "Mark Complete" button
                          ↓
                    One click → Task created
                    One click → Note updated
                    Batch execute → All actions done
```

### Key Innovations:

1. **AI Generates Executable Specifications**
   - Not just "write tests" but complete task spec with description, priority, tags

2. **Preview Before Execute**
   - User can edit any field before creating
   - See full details in expandable cards

3. **Context-Aware Updates**
   - AI suggests updates to existing items based on session
   - Explains WHY each update is needed
   - Prevents duplicates

4. **Batch Intelligence**
   - Groups related actions
   - Execute all at once or individually
   - Progress tracking

5. **Seamless Integration**
   - Reuses existing TasksContext/NotesContext
   - No API changes needed
   - Works with existing storage system
