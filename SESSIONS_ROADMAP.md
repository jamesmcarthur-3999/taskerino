**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10

---

## üìã Current State (Completed)

### Core Functionality ‚úÖ
- [x] Session lifecycle management (start, pause, resume, stop)
- [x] Automatic screenshot capture (configurable interval, default 2min)
- [x] AI vision analysis of screenshots using Claude Sonnet 4.5
- [x] Timeline view with AI analysis results
- [x] User comments on screenshots
- [x] Screenshot flagging system
- [x] Session summary generation (tasks, notes, time breakdown)
- [x] Navigation island integration for quick session controls
- [x] Context window system (maintains last 5 screenshots for better AI context)
- [x] Activity type tracking
- [x] Tag support for sessions

### What Works Well
- Screenshot capture is reliable and non-intrusive
- AI analysis provides valuable insights (activity detection, OCR, suggested actions)
- Session controls are easily accessible from navigation
- Timeline provides good chronological view of work

### Known Limitations
- Cannot view actual screenshot images (only see AI analysis)
- Suggested tasks/notes from AI aren't actionable (can't easily save them)
- Past sessions are just a list - hard to explore or get value from
- No visual representation of time spent on different activities
- Storage can grow large with screenshots (need cleanup)

## üìù Development Notes

### Technical Debt / Future Improvements
