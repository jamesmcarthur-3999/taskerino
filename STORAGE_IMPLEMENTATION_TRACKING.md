# Storage System Upgrade - Implementation Tracking

**Branch:** `feature/storage-system-upgrade`
**Start Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Key Principles

1. **Quality over Speed** - Move slowly, ensure highest quality implementation
2. **Complete Coverage** - Upgrade ALL collections (sessions, notes, tasks, topics, companies, contacts)
3. **Agent Coordination** - Multiple agents working in parallel with careful coordination
4. **Validation First** - Every change validated before proceeding
5. **Zero Data Loss** - All changes must preserve existing data

## Overall Progress

- [x] Phase 1: Emergency Fixes (5/5 tasks) - 100% complete
  - [x] 1.1 Mandatory Backup System
  - [x] 1.2 Remove Enrichment Skip Logic
  - [x] 1.3 Automatic Backups
  - [x] 1.4 Recovery UI
  - [x] 1.5 Complete Export/Import
- [ ] Phase 2: Robust Foundation (0/4 tasks)
- [ ] Phase 3: Scale & Performance (0/5 tasks)

**Total Progress:** 5/14 major tasks complete (36%)

**Agent Assignment:** Claude (Phase 1.1 Agent)
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-23

**Critical Code Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (line 158)
catch (error) {
  console.warn(`Failed to create backup for ${collection}:`, error);
  // Continue anyway - not critical  ← DANGEROUS
}

// AFTER
catch (error) {
  throw new Error(`CRITICAL: Backup failed for ${collection}: ${error.message}`);
}
```

---

### 1.2 Remove Enrichment Skip Logic ✅ COMPLETED

**File:** `/src/context/SessionsContext.tsx`

**Dependencies:** None
**Blocks:** None (but Phase 2.4 transactions will fully resolve enrichment conflicts)
**Agent Assignment:** Claude (Phase 1.2 Agent)
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-23

  s => s.enrichmentStatus?.status === 'in-progress'
);

if (hasEnrichmentInProgress) {
  console.log('⏸️ Skipping debounced save - enrichment in progress');
  return;  // ← DELETE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK
}

**Files Changed:**
- `/src/App.tsx` (3 new useEffect hooks added after line 307)

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Startup Backup Hook (Lines 308-333):**
   - Runs once on mount after app initialization
   - Creates backup using `storage.createBackup()`
   - Shows user notification if backup fails (uses AppContext dispatch)
   - Logs success with backup ID to console

2. **Shutdown Backup Hook (Lines 335-356):**

   - Creates backup BEFORE calling `storage.shutdown()`
   - Ensures data is backed up before app closes
   - Logs all operations for debugging

3. **Hourly Backup Hook (Lines 358-376):**
   - Creates backup immediately on mount
   - Sets up setInterval to run every hour (3600000ms)
   - Properly cleans up interval on unmount
   - Logs each hourly backup with backup ID

**Code Quality:**
- All hooks use empty dependency arrays (run once on mount)
- Proper cleanup functions for intervals and event listeners

**Implementation Details:**
- Added "System Backups" section in Data tab (after Backup & Restore, before Danger Zone)
- "Create Backup Now" button with error handling and notifications
- BackupList component with:
  - Loading state ("Loading backups...")
  - Empty state ("No backups available")
  - Backup cards showing timestamp, age (e.g., "2 hours ago"), and size in MB
  - Restore button with confirmation dialog

**Dependencies:** 1.1 (import needs to create backup) ✅
**Blocks:** None
**Agent Assignment:** Claude (Phase 1.5 Agent)
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-23

**Files Changed:**
- `/src/components/ProfileZone.tsx` (updated handleExportData and handleImportData functions, lines 121-271)

**Implementation Details:**

**New handleExportData (lines 121-184):**
- Exports directly from storage using `getStorage()` and `storage.load()` for completeness
- Includes ALL 8 collections:
  - **Entities**: topics, companies, contacts
  - **Content**: notes, tasks, sessions
  - **Settings**: aiSettings, preferences
- Adds metadata:
  - `exportedAt`: ISO timestamp
  - `version`: '1.0.0' (export format version for future compatibility)
  - `appVersion`: '0.5.1' (from tauri.conf.json)
- Generates timestamped filename: `taskerino-export-{timestamp}.json`
- Shows success notification with message about attachments being excluded
- Error handling with user-friendly error notifications
- Note: Attachments NOT included (too large, planned for Phase 3)

**New handleImportData (lines 186-271):**
- File format validation:
  - Checks for required `version` and `exportedAt` fields
  - Rejects files missing metadata with clear error message
- Version compatibility check:
  - Only accepts version '1.0.0' exports
  - Future versions can implement migration logic
- Detailed user confirmation:
  - Counts items in each collection
  - Shows formatted confirmation dialog with all counts
  - Warns that current data will be backed up before import
- Pre-import backup (CRITICAL):
  - Creates mandatory backup using Phase 1.1 system
  - Console logs: `[Import] Creating pre-import backup...`
  - Halts import if backup fails
- Imports all 8 collections in order:
  1. topics → companies → contacts (entities)
  2. notes → tasks → sessions (content)
  3. aiSettings → preferences (settings)
- Success notification with restart reminder
- File input reset after import (success or failure)
- Comprehensive error handling

**Export File Structure:**
```json
{
  "topics": [...],
  "companies": [...],
  "contacts": [...],
  "notes": [...],
  "tasks": [...],
  "sessions": [...],
  "aiSettings": {...},
  "preferences": {...},
  "exportedAt": "2025-10-23T10:00:00.000Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "appVersion": "0.5.1"
}
```

**Critical Changes:**
- ✅ Export reads from storage.load() instead of context state
- ✅ Includes sessions, companies, contacts (previously missing)
- ✅ Added version field for future compatibility
- ✅ Import validates file format before proceeding
- ✅ Pre-import backup uses Phase 1.1 mandatory backup system
- ✅ Detailed confirmation dialog with item counts

## Risk Log

### Active Risks

1. **Data Loss During Migration (HIGH)** - Phase 2.2 migration could fail
   - Mitigation: Mandatory backup before migration
   - Owner: Migration Agent
   - Status: MONITORING

2. **Performance Regression (MEDIUM)** - Phase 3 features could slow things down
   - Mitigation: Continuous benchmarking, feature flags
   - Owner: Validation Agent
   - Status: MONITORING

3. **Enrichment Race Conditions (MEDIUM)** - Phase 1.2 removes safety but Phase 2.4 fixes properly
   - Mitigation: Fast transition to Phase 2, reduced debounce to 1s
   - Owner: Context Agent, Transaction Agent
   - Status: MONITORING

---

## Blocking Issues

**None currently**

## Notes for Future Agents

### Important Files to Read First

1. `/STORAGE_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` - Complete technical specification
2. `/CLAUDE.md` - Architecture overview
3. This file - Current progress tracking

### Code Reading Priority

1. `/src/services/storage/TauriFileSystemAdapter.ts` - Core storage implementation
2. `/src/context/SessionsContext.tsx` - Session state management (has enrichment skip logic)
3. `/src/services/sessionEnrichmentService.ts` - Direct storage writes (race condition source)
4. `/src/components/ProfileZone.tsx` - Export/import + recovery UI location
5. `/src/App.tsx` - Application startup hooks

### Testing Approach

1. **Unit tests first** - Test each method in isolation
2. **Integration tests second** - Test interactions between components
3. **Load tests third** - Test with realistic data volumes
4. **Chaos tests last** - Test crash scenarios, corruption, etc.

### Quality Standards

1. **No silent failures** - All errors must be logged and/or shown to user
2. **No data loss** - Backups before risky operations
3. **Performance targets met** - Benchmarks must pass
4. **100% test coverage** - For critical paths (storage, migrations)
5. **Clean code** - TypeScript strict mode, no any types, proper error handling
