# Storage Transactions Architecture

**Version:** 2.0.0
**Status:** Implemented
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-24

## Overview

This document describes the atomic transaction system for Taskerino's storage layer. The transaction system prevents data corruption by ensuring that multi-key storage operations either succeed completely or fail completely, with no partial state.

## Design Goals

1. **Atomicity**: All operations in a transaction succeed or all fail together
2. **Consistency**: Storage state remains consistent across failures
3. **Durability**: Committed transactions persist across crashes
4. **Performance**: Minimal overhead for single-operation writes
5. **Cross-Platform**: Identical behavior on IndexedDB (web) and Tauri FS (desktop)

## Architecture

### Transaction Interface

```typescript
export interface StorageTransaction {
  save(key: string, value: any): void;
  delete(key: string): void;
  commit(): Promise<void>;
  rollback(): Promise<void>;
  getPendingOperations(): number;
}
```

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { getStorage } from '@/services/storage';

const storage = await getStorage();
const tx = await storage.beginTransaction();

try {
  tx.save('sessions', updatedSessions);
  tx.save('activeSessionId', sessionId);
  tx.save('settings', newSettings);
  await tx.commit();  // All writes succeed or all fail
} catch (error) {
  await tx.rollback();  // Restore previous state
  throw error;
}
```

## Implementation Details

### IndexedDB Adapter

**Strategy**: Native IDBTransaction for atomicity

**Key Features**:
- Uses IndexedDB's built-in transaction support
- Captures previous values before commit for rollback
- Automatic rollback on IDBTransaction errors
- Single transaction per commit (all operations batched)

**Atomicity Guarantee**: IndexedDB's native ACID transactions ensure that all operations succeed or all fail. If any operation fails, the entire IDBTransaction is automatically rolled back by the browser.

**Code Flow**:
```
1. beginTransaction() → Create IndexedDBTransaction instance
2. save/delete() → Queue operations (not executed yet)
3. commit() →
   a. Capture previous values (for rollback)
   b. Prepare all data (compress, serialize)
   c. Create single IDBTransaction with 'readwrite' mode
   d. Queue all operations to IDBTransaction
   e. Wait for tx.oncomplete or tx.onerror
   f. On error: Call rollback() to restore previous state
```

**Performance**:
- Capturing previous values: O(n) where n = number of operations
- Commit: O(n) for preparation + single IDBTransaction
- Rollback: O(n) to restore previous values

### Tauri File System Adapter

**Strategy**: Staging directory + atomic rename

**Key Features**:
- Writes to temporary directory first
- Captures previous file contents before overwrite
- Atomic move to final location (OS-level atomicity)
- Automatic cleanup on failure

**Atomicity Guarantee**: File system operations are atomic per-file. The adapter achieves multi-file atomicity by:
1. Writing to temp directory first (isolated from final state)
2. Creating backups of existing files
3. Moving files to final location only after all temp writes succeed
4. On failure: Cleaning up temp directory and restoring from backups

**Code Flow**:
```
1. beginTransaction() → Create TauriFileSystemTransaction instance
2. save/delete() → Queue operations (not executed yet)
3. commit() →
   a. Capture previous file contents (for rollback)
   b. Create temp directory (.tx-{timestamp})
   c. Write all files to temp directory
   d. For each operation (sequentially):
      - Create backup of existing file (if exists)
      - Move temp file to final location
      - Track written files
   e. Clean up temp directory
   f. On error: Restore from backups, clean up
```

**Performance**:
- Capturing previous values: O(n) file reads
- Commit: O(n) writes to temp + O(n) moves + O(n) backups
- Rollback: O(n) file restores

## Transaction Guarantees

### What IS Guaranteed

✅ **Atomicity**: All operations succeed together or fail together
✅ **State Restoration**: Rollback restores exact previous state
✅ **Durability**: Committed transactions persist across crashes
✅ **Isolation**: Individual transactions see consistent state
✅ **No Partial Writes**: Never see half-committed transactions

### What is NOT Guaranteed

❌ **Serializable Isolation**: Concurrent transactions may conflict (last write wins)
❌ **Optimistic Locking**: No version checking (separate feature, see Phase 2.4)
❌ **Distributed Transactions**: Single-device only
❌ **Cross-Adapter Atomicity**: IndexedDB and Tauri FS are independent

## Rollback Behavior

### Successful Rollback

When `rollback()` is called on a pending transaction:

1. **Restore Previous Values**: For each operation, restore the value that existed before the transaction
2. **Delete New Keys**: For save operations on non-existent keys, remove the key
3. **Keep Deleted Keys**: For delete operations, restore the deleted value
4. **Clear Queue**: Remove all pending operations

**Example**:
```typescript
// Initial state: { col1: {v:1}, col2: {v:1} }
const tx = await storage.beginTransaction();
tx.save('col1', { v: 2 });  // Modify
tx.save('col3', { v: 3 });  // Create new
tx.delete('col2');          // Delete

await tx.rollback();
// Final state: { col1: {v:1}, col2: {v:1} }
// - col1 restored to v:1
// - col3 never created
// - col2 restored
```

### Automatic Rollback on Error

Both adapters automatically rollback on commit errors:

**IndexedDB**: IDBTransaction errors trigger automatic rollback
**Tauri FS**: Any file operation error triggers cleanup and restore from backups

## Performance Characteristics

### IndexedDB

| Operation | Time Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Queue operation | O(1) | Just array push |
| Capture previous | O(n) | n = operations, parallel reads |
| Prepare data | O(n) | Serialize + compress |
| Commit | O(n) | Single IDBTransaction |
| Rollback | O(n) | Restore from captured values |

**Benchmark Results** (from tests):
- 1000 operations commit: ~97ms (0.097ms per op)
- 100 operations rollback: ~17ms (0.17ms per op)

### Tauri File System

| Operation | Time Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Queue operation | O(1) | Just array push |
| Capture previous | O(n) | n = operations, sequential reads |
| Write to temp | O(n) | Sequential writes |
| Move to final | O(n) | Sequential moves |
| Rollback | O(n) | Sequential restores |

**Note**: File system operations are inherently slower than in-memory IndexedDB operations, but still achieve acceptable performance for typical transaction sizes (<100 operations).

## Error Handling

### Commit Errors

**IndexedDB**:
- IDBTransaction `onerror`: Automatic rollback by browser
- Quota exceeded: Transaction fails, storage remains consistent
- Browser crash: Uncommitted transactions lost (expected)

**Tauri FS**:
- Write failure: Temp directory cleaned up, no final state modified
- Move failure: Previous files restored from backups
- Backup failure: Transaction aborted (CRITICAL error, will not proceed)

### Rollback Errors

If rollback itself fails (rare):
- Log error to console
- Clear operation queue to prevent double-rollback
- Storage may be in inconsistent state (CRITICAL)

**Mitigation**: Regular backups via `createBackup()` provide recovery path

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Coverage**: >90% for transaction code

**Test Categories**:
1. **Atomic Commit**: Verify all-or-nothing behavior
2. **Rollback**: Verify state restoration
3. **Concurrent**: Multiple transactions, sequential and parallel
4. **Edge Cases**: Empty transactions, large transactions, same key multiple times
5. **Performance**: Benchmarks for commit/rollback speed

**Test Files**:
- `tests/storage/transactions.test.ts` (26 tests)

### Integration Tests

**Scenarios**:
- Session end → Update multiple collections atomically
- Enrichment pipeline → Multi-step updates
- Settings change → Update config + invalidate caches

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2.4: Optimistic Locking

Add version checking to detect concurrent modifications:

```typescript
// Current version before read
const session = await storage.load<Session>('session-123');
const currentVersion = session.version || 0;

// Transaction with version check
const tx = await storage.beginTransaction();
tx.save('session-123', {
  ...session,
  version: currentVersion + 1,  // Increment version
  data: updatedData,
});

// If another transaction committed between read and this commit,
// version check fails and transaction is rejected
await tx.commit({ expectedVersion: currentVersion });
```

**Status**: Not yet implemented (planned for Phase 2.4)

### Phase 2.4: Nested Transactions (Savepoints)

Support for nested transactions with partial rollback:

```typescript
const outerTx = await storage.beginTransaction();
outerTx.save('outer', data);

const savepoint = outerTx.createSavepoint();
outerTx.save('inner', data);

// Rollback to savepoint (keeps 'outer', removes 'inner')
await outerTx.rollbackToSavepoint(savepoint);

await outerTx.commit(); // Commits 'outer' only
```

**Status**: Deferred to Phase 2.4 (not required for Phase 1)

**Rationale**: While nested transactions are a valuable feature for complex workflows, they add significant implementation complexity. The current transaction system provides the core atomicity guarantees needed for all Phase 1 use cases. Nested transaction support will be added in Phase 2.4 alongside optimistic locking and other advanced transaction features.
