## Why Archive?

Taskerino archives historical documentation rather than deleting it for several reasons:

1. **Preserve Institutional Knowledge** - Understand why decisions were made
2. **Historical Context** - See how features evolved over time
3. **Reference for Similar Work** - Learn from past implementations
4. **Searchability** - Find past solutions to problems
5. **Audit Trail** - Track project evolution and progress

---

## Using the Archive

### Finding Feature Documentation
If you're working on a feature and want to understand its history:

1. Check `archive/features/{feature-name}/` for implementation docs
2. Look for completion reports and status summaries
3. Review any related review or audit reports

**Example**: To understand how audio review was implemented:
- Check `archive/features/audio/AUDIO_REVIEW_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
- Look at `archive/reports/reviews/` for any audio-related reviews

### Understanding Past Decisions
If you need context on why something was built a certain way:

1. Search feature archives for design rationale
2. Check architectural reviews in `archive/reports/reviews/`
3. Review Option C refactor docs for navigation system decisions

**Example**: To understand navigation architecture:
- Read `archive/option-c-navigation-refactor/README.md`
- Review `archive/option-c-navigation-refactor/EPILOGUE.md`

### Learning from Past Work
If you're implementing a similar feature:

1. Search archive for similar implementations
2. Review completion reports for lessons learned
3. Check phase reports for multi-phase project patterns

## Notable Archives

### Option C Navigation Refactor (October 2025)
**Location**: `option-c-navigation-refactor/`
**Significance**: Successful architecture refactor demonstrating incremental improvement

- Replaced complex JavaScript positioning with CSS layout
- 79% performance improvement (14ms → 3ms)
- 350 lines of code removed
- Later evolved to CSS Grid + React Portals
- Excellent example of successful refactoring

**Key Files**:
- `README.md` - Archive overview
- `EPILOGUE.md` - What happened after implementation
- `OPTION_C_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Original 7-phase plan

### Sessions Feature Evolution
**Location**: `features/sessions/`
**Significance**: Evolution before the comprehensive rewrite

- `SESSIONS_FEATURE_COMPLETE.md` - Original feature completion
- `SESSIONS_ROADMAP.md` - Original roadmap
- `SESSION_LOADING_ANALYSIS.md` - Performance analysis that informed Phase 4

### Performance Optimization Work
**Location**: `features/performance/`
**Significance**: Systematic performance improvements

- Multiple optimization tasks and validation reports
- Performance audit and implementation roadmap
- Informed Phase 4 storage architecture

## Archival Policy

**When to Archive**:
- Feature is complete and documented
- Implementation approach has been superseded
- Status/completion reports after project finish
- Phase reports after phase completion
- Reports that are purely historical

**When NOT to Archive**:
- Current architecture documentation
- Active project documentation
- User-facing guides
- API references in active use

**How to Archive**:
1. Move file to appropriate `archive/` subdirectory
2. Update any references in active documentation
3. Add entry to this README if significant
4. Do NOT delete - archives are permanent
