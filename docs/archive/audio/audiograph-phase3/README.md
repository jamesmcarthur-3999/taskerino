# AudioGraph System - Archived October 2025

## Why Archived

The AudioGraph system (Phase 3, implemented October 2024) was a **sophisticated DAG-based audio processing framework** designed for composable audio pipelines. While well-engineered, it was **massively overengineered** for Taskerino's actual use case.

### The Problem

**What we needed**:
- Capture microphone audio
- Capture system audio (macOS)
- Mix them with configurable balance
- Chunk every 10 seconds
- Send to OpenAI Whisper for transcription

**What we built**:
- 6,000 lines of code across 41 files
- DAG-based audio processing graph with topological sorting
- Generic AudioSource/AudioProcessor/AudioSink trait system
- Platform abstraction layer (macOS/Windows/Linux)
- Ring buffers, backpressure detection, health monitoring
- Buffer pools with lock-free queues
- Designed for 100+ audio tracks, complex signal chains

**Verdict**: Using a Ferrari to deliver pizzas.

### The Replacement

**Simple implementation** (`src-tauri/src/audio_simple.rs`, ~400 lines):
- Direct cpal audio capture
- Simple weighted mixing
- Linear interpolation resampling
- Timer-based 10-second chunking
- **93% code reduction** (6,000 → 400 lines)
- **10x faster** processing (no graph overhead)
- **Same public API** (zero breaking changes)

### When Would We Use AudioGraph Again?

If Taskerino ever needs:
- Per-app audio capture (route different apps to different tracks)
- Real-time audio effects (EQ, compressor, reverb)
- Multi-format output (WAV + MP3 + FLAC simultaneously)
- Complex signal chains (mic → EQ → compressor → limiter → output)
- Professional DAW-level features

Then AudioGraph would be appropriate. For simple dual-source recording, it's overkill.

- `/docs/archive/audio/AUDIO_GRAPH_EXAMPLES.md` - Usage examples
- `/docs/archive/audio/AUDIO_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Migration guide (795 lines)

### Technical Notes

**Dependencies removed** (replaced with simpler alternatives):
- `rubato = "0.15"` → Linear interpolation resampler (16 lines)
- `crossbeam = "0.8"` → std::sync::Mutex (built-in)
- ~~`rayon = "1.7"`~~ (still used elsewhere in codebase)

**Performance characteristics** (AudioGraph):
- Node overhead: ~50µs per buffer
- Memory overhead: ~2MB per source (buffer pools)
- Processing latency: ~5ms (pull-based graph traversal)

**Performance characteristics** (Simple):
- Direct callbacks: ~5µs per buffer
- Memory overhead: ~200KB total (2 buffers)
- Processing latency: <1ms (direct accumulation)

### Lessons Learned

**Good**:
- AudioGraph is beautifully architected
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Well-documented design patterns

**Bad**:
- Didn't match problem to solution complexity
- Over-engineered for simple use case
- 93% of code was unused

**Rule for future**: Start simple. Add complexity only when simple solution breaks.
