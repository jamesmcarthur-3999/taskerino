**Specific Use-Case for Taskerino:**
Create an enhanced session monitoring dashboard that shows live audio activity during active sessions. The Bar Visualizer displays ambient audio levels, helping users understand when they're actively speaking vs. silent. Combined with screenshot intervals and task extractions, this creates a comprehensive "focus meter" showing engagement patterns throughout the session.

**Implementation Details:**
- Add Bar Visualizer to Active Session Controls panel
- Display live audio levels even when not actively recording
- Use different visualization colors for different audio states:
  - Green: Active speech detected (user speaking)
  - Blue: Ambient noise (music, background sounds)
  - Gray: Silence
- Integrate Mic Selector in session settings for multi-mic setups
- Calculate "focus score" based on speech patterns:
  - High: Long periods of speech with screenshots
  - Medium: Intermittent speech with some silence
  - Low: Mostly silence or ambient noise
- Store audio activity metadata (not full audio) for session analytics
- Show focus patterns in session summaries and enrichment reports

**User Benefit/Value Proposition:**
