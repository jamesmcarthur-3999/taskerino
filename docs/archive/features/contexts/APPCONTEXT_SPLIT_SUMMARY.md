# AppContext Split - Executive Summary

## Problem
The current monolithic AppContext contains ALL application state (145+ actions, 20+ state fields). Every state change triggers re-renders across the ENTIRE app, even in completely unrelated zones.

**Performance Impact:**
- Changing a task re-renders NotesZone, LibraryZone, SessionsZone (unnecessary)
- Changing a note re-renders TasksZone, SessionsZone (unnecessary)
- Opening sidebar re-renders all data zones (unnecessary)
- Settings changes re-render everything (unnecessary)

**Estimated waste:** 70-85% of re-renders are unnecessary.

---

## Solution
Split AppContext into 6 specialized contexts, each responsible for one domain:

1. **SettingsContext** - AI settings, learning settings, user profile, Ned settings
2. **UIContext** - Navigation, modals, sidebar, notifications, onboarding, Ned conversation
3. **EntitiesContext** - Companies, contacts, topics (entities only)
4. **NotesContext** - Notes management
5. **TasksContext** - Tasks management
6. **SessionsContext** - Recording sessions, screenshots, audio

**Benefits:**
- 70-85% reduction in unnecessary re-renders
- Changing tasks only re-renders TasksZone
- Changing notes only re-renders LibraryZone/NotesZone
- UI changes (sidebar, modals) don't re-render data zones
- Settings changes only re-render SettingsModal

## Context Hierarchy & Dependencies

```
SettingsProvider           ‚Üê No dependencies
  ‚Üì
UIProvider                 ‚Üê Can use Settings
  ‚Üì
EntitiesProvider           ‚Üê Independent
  ‚Üì
NotesProvider              ‚Üê Uses Entities (to update noteCounts)
  ‚Üì
TasksProvider              ‚Üê Can use Entities (optional)
  ‚Üì
SessionsProvider           ‚Üê Can use Tasks/Notes (optional)
  ‚Üì
<App />
```

**Why this order matters:**
- Inner providers can access outer providers
- Outer providers CANNOT access inner providers
- This prevents circular dependencies

## High-Level Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Create Contexts (11.5 hours)
1. Create SettingsContext (1 hr)
2. Create UIContext (1.5 hrs)
3. Rename AppContext ‚Üí EntitiesContext (1.5 hrs)
4. Create TasksContext (2 hrs)
5. Create NotesContext (2 hrs)
6. Create SessionsContext (3 hrs)

### Phase 2: Provider Nesting (30 min)
Nest all providers in correct order in App.tsx

### Phase 3: Component Migration (10 hours)
Migrate 36+ components from `useApp()` to specialized hooks:
- `useSettings()`
- `useUI()`
- `useEntities()`
- `useTasks()`
- `useNotes()`
- `useSessions()`

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (2 hours)
- Test all features work
- Measure re-render reduction with React DevTools Profiler
- Validate data persistence
- Check for regressions

**Total Time:** 24 hours (ideal), 28-30 hours (realistic with debugging)

---

## Critical Success Factors

### Must Do Right:
1. **Provider order** - Must match dependency tree or app crashes
2. **Storage compatibility** - Must work with existing localStorage data
3. **Cross-context updates** - Notes must update entity noteCounts correctly
4. **Critical saves** - Screenshots/audio must save immediately (no data loss)

### Testing Priorities:
1. **Data integrity** - No data loss on crash/reload
2. **Re-render reduction** - Measure with React DevTools (target: 70-85% reduction)
3. **Feature completeness** - All features still work
4. **Performance** - No degradation, only improvement

---

## Risk Assessment

### Medium Risk:
- Cross-context updates (Notes updating Entity noteCounts)
- Storage migration from old format
- Provider nesting order

### Low Risk:
- Individual context creation
- Most component migrations
- UI state separation

### Mitigation:
- Git tag `before-context-split` for instant rollback
- Validate after each context creation
- Test each component immediately after migration
- Use same storage keys (backwards compatible)

---

## Expected Results

### Before:
```
User creates task ‚Üí 50+ components re-render
User edits note ‚Üí 50+ components re-render
User toggles sidebar ‚Üí 50+ components re-render
```

### After:
```
User creates task ‚Üí Only TasksZone components re-render (~7 components)
User edits note ‚Üí Only LibraryZone components re-render (~5 components)
User toggles sidebar ‚Üí Only UI components re-render (~3 components)
```

**Performance improvement:** 70-85% reduction in re-renders

## Timeline

| Week | Tasks | Hours |
|------|-------|-------|
| Week 1 | Create all contexts + provider nesting | 12 hrs |
| Week 2 | Migrate Priority 1 & 2 components | 6 hrs |
| Week 3 | Migrate Priority 3 components + testing | 6 hrs |

**Total:** 3 weeks part-time OR 3-4 days full-time

## Go/No-Go Decision

### Go if:
- [ ] You have 24+ hours available
- [ ] You're comfortable with React Context API
- [ ] You can afford potential bugs during migration
- [ ] Performance is a priority

### No-Go if:
- [ ] You're under tight deadline
- [ ] The app is in production with no backup
- [ ] You're not familiar with Context API
- [ ] Current performance is acceptable

## Next Steps

1. Read the full implementation plan: `APPCONTEXT_SPLIT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
2. Set up git branch: `git checkout -b perf/split-app-context`
3. Create git tag: `git tag before-context-split`
4. Start with Phase 1: Create SettingsContext
5. Follow the plan step-by-step
6. Validate after each step
7. Test thoroughly before merging

**Remember:** This is a marathon, not a sprint. Take it slow and test thoroughly.

Good luck! üöÄ
