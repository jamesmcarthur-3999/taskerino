# Option C Navigation Refactor - Historical Archive

**Status**: IMPLEMENTED (October 2025), LATER EVOLVED
**Archival Date**: October 26, 2025

## What was Option C?

Option C was a successful navigation architecture refactor that replaced complex JavaScript position calculations with a CSS flexbox-based layout system. It was fully implemented in October 2025 and later evolved to CSS Grid + React Portals.

## Implementation Status

✅ All 7 phases completed
✅ NavigationCoordinationContext deleted
✅ Code reduced by 350 lines (32%)
✅ Performance improved 79% (14ms → 3ms)
✅ Later evolved to CSS Grid + React Portals

## Why Archived?

These documents represent the original plan. The implementation was successful but later evolved. Archived for historical reference and as an example of successful incremental refactoring.

## Current Architecture

For the current navigation system, see: `/src/components/TopNavigation/README.md`
