### 2. ✅ Fixed Scrolling Glitch

**Issue:** Screen was glitching, flickering, and jumping back to middle when scrolling

**Root Causes:**
1. `snap-mandatory` was too aggressive, forcing snap even during active scrolling
2. State updates during scroll caused re-renders that interfered with smooth scrolling
3. Circular dependency between local state and global state causing unwanted scrollToZone calls
4. Scroll position calculations conflicted with CSS snap behavior

**Final Solution: IntersectionObserver**

Instead of calculating scroll position, we now use IntersectionObserver to detect which zone is actually visible:

```typescript
// Use IntersectionObserver to detect which zone is visible
const observerOptions = {
  root: container,
  threshold: 0.5, // Zone is "active" when 50% visible
};

const observerCallback = (entries: IntersectionObserverEntry[]) => {
  // Don't update if we're in the middle of programmatic scrolling
  if (isScrollingProgrammatically.current) return;

  entries.forEach((entry) => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      const target = entry.target as HTMLElement;
      const newZone = target.dataset.zone as Zone;

      if (newZone && newZone !== currentZone) {
        setCurrentZone(newZone);
        dispatch({ type: 'SET_ZONE', payload: newZone });
      }
    }
  });
};

const observer = new IntersectionObserver(observerCallback, observerOptions);
observer.observe(assistantRef.current);
observer.observe(captureRef.current);
observer.observe(libraryRef.current);
```

**Key Improvements:**
1. **IntersectionObserver** - Detects which zone is 50%+ visible (much more reliable)
2. **Programmatic scroll guard** - Prevents observer from triggering during button clicks
3. **No scroll position math** - Let CSS snap do its job, we just observe the result
4. **No circular dependencies** - Removed the useEffect that was causing loops
5. **Data attributes** - Each zone has `data-zone="assistant|capture|library"`

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero flickering or jumping
- ✅ Smooth scrolling in all directions
- ✅ CSS snap works perfectly
- ✅ Navigation arrows and indicators update correctly
- ✅ Works with both manual scrolling and button navigation
- ✅ More robust and maintainable code

### 3. ✅ Improved AI Prompting for Better Note Organization

**Issue:** Call transcripts created too many scattered notes instead of one comprehensive note per customer

**Root Cause:**
- AI prompt didn't establish topic hierarchy (customer > person > feature)
- No guidance on note consolidation for long inputs
- Didn't consider existing notes when deciding create vs update
- Response format allowed multiple notes per input

**Solution: Restructured AI Prompt & Processing Logic**

#### Changes to AI Prompt (claudeService.ts lines 58-138)

**Added CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **Topic Hierarchy**:
   - PRIMARY: Customer/Company (most important)
   - SECONDARY: People mentioned
   - TERTIARY: Features, products, technologies

2. **Note Consolidation**:
   - Call transcripts → ONE comprehensive note
   - Quick notes → One focused note
   - Never create multiple notes from single input

3. **Update vs Create**:
   - Check recent notes for same customer
   - Consider updating existing notes instead of creating new

**Added Context:**
- Recent notes (last 10) provided to AI
- Existing topics with types
- Input type detection (call_transcript | meeting_note | quick_note)

**New Response Format:**
```json
{
  "inputType": "call_transcript",
  "primaryTopic": {
    "name": "Acme Corp",
    "type": "company"
  },
  "secondaryTopics": [
    {"name": "Sarah", "type": "person", "relationTo": "Acme Corp"},
    {"name": "Enterprise Plan", "type": "product"}
  ],
  "noteStrategy": {
    "action": "create",
    "shouldConsolidate": true
  },
  "note": {  // Singular! One note per input
    "content": "Comprehensive call summary...",
    "summary": "Brief summary",
    "topicAssociation": "Acme Corp"
  },
  "tasks": [...],
  "tags": [...],
  "sentiment": "positive"
}
```

#### Changes to Processing Logic (claudeService.ts lines 161-281)

**Before:**
- Processed all topics equally
- Created note for EACH topic
- One input → Many notes 😞

**After:**
- Process PRIMARY topic first
- Process SECONDARY topics as related entities
- Create ONE note for primary topic only
- Link all tasks to primary topic
- Secondary topics exist but don't get duplicate notes

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Call transcripts create one comprehensive note per customer
- ✅ Clear topic hierarchy (customer-first)
- ✅ Better note consolidation
- ✅ AI considers existing notes before creating new
- ✅ Much cleaner organization
- ✅ Less clutter in library view

**Example:**

Input: "45-min call with Sarah and Robert from Justworks about AI Visibility feature..."

Old behavior:
- Note for Justworks ✓
- Note for Sarah ✓
- Note for Robert ✓
- Note for AI Visibility ✓
- Note for Productiv ✓
- **Result: 5+ scattered notes** 😞

New behavior:
- **One comprehensive note** under Justworks (primary)
- Topics created: Justworks (primary), Sarah, Robert, AI Visibility (secondary)
- All tasks linked to Justworks
- **Result: 1 well-organized note** ✅

---

### 4. ✅ Added Task-to-Note Association & Source Text Preservation

**User Requirement:**
> "Tasks should also be associated with a note, so I can see the context. Each note should also retain the source material linked in the note so I can see where it came from. (Useful for validation from user as well)"

**Changes Made:**

#### 1. Tasks Now Link to Notes
- Added `noteId` field to Task type (already existed, now utilized)
- Updated task creation to link to the note that generated them
- All tasks from a single input now reference the same note for context

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// CaptureZone.tsx lines 116-125
const primaryNote = createdNotes[0]; // The main note created
result.tasks.forEach(taskResult => {
  const newTask = createTask(taskResult.title, {
    priority: taskResult.priority,
    topicId: taskResult.topicId,
    noteId: primaryNote?.id, // Link task to note for context
  });
  dispatch({ type: 'ADD_TASK', payload: newTask });
});
```

#### 2. Notes Now Store Original Source Text
- Added `sourceText` field to Note type (types.ts line 17)
- Updated note creation to preserve original input
- Useful for validation and seeing exactly what was captured

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// types.ts
export interface Note {
  ...
  sourceText?: string; // Original input text (for validation)
  ...
}

// helpers.ts lines 31-42
export function createNote(..., options?) {
  return {
    ...
    sourceText: options?.sourceText, // Store original input
    ...
  };
}

// CaptureZone.tsx lines 83-95
const newNote = createNote(topicId, content, summary, {
  tags: result.keyTopics,
  sourceText: noteResult.sourceText, // Preserve source
  metadata: { ... },
});
```

#### 3. AI Processing Updated
- `AIProcessResult.notes` now includes `sourceText` field
- `AIProcessResult.tasks` now includes `noteId` field
- Source text flows from capture → AI processing → note creation

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Task Context**: Click a task and see the full note that generated it
- ✅ **Validation**: View original source material to verify AI interpretation
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Know exactly what was captured vs what AI extracted
- ✅ **Quality Control**: Easy to spot AI misinterpretations
- ✅ **Transparency**: Users can see the "raw data" behind processed notes

**Example:**

User captures:
```
Had a call with Sarah at Justworks. She wants pricing by Friday.
Need to schedule demo next week.
```

Result:
- **Note created** with:
  - `content`: "Call with Sarah (Justworks) - Discussed pricing and demo timeline..."
  - `sourceText`: "Had a call with Sarah at Justworks. She wants pricing by Friday..."

- **Tasks created** with:
  - Task 1: "Send pricing to Justworks"
    - `noteId`: links to note above
    - `topicId`: "Justworks"
  - Task 2: "Schedule demo for Justworks"
    - `noteId`: links to same note
    - `topicId`: "Justworks"

**Future UI Enhancement Ideas:**
- Show "View Source" button in note detail modal
- Display source text in expandable section
- Link from task → note → source text chain
- Highlight differences between source and AI summary

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate
- ✅ **DONE:** Update to latest model
- ✅ **DONE:** Fix scrolling issues (using scrollend event)
- 🔄 **USER TESTING:** Try the app with fixed scrolling

### Scrolling Fix Details
The scrolling issue has been resolved by:
1. Using `scrollend` event instead of continuous scroll monitoring
2. Only updating zone state when scrolling stops (prevents re-renders during scroll)
3. Simplified zone detection logic using `Math.round()`
4. Removed throttle function (no longer needed)

This approach completely eliminates flickering since state updates no longer interfere with active scrolling.

### Optional Enhancements
- Add better error messages
- Add retry logic for API failures
- Add streaming for faster responses
- Add token usage tracking
- Add dark mode

## 💡 Usage Notes

### Current Model Capabilities

**Claude Sonnet 4.5** is Anthropic's best model as of Sept 2025:
- **Best for:** Complex agents, coding, agentic tasks
- **Context window:** 200k tokens (1M available with beta)
- **Pricing:** Same as before ($3/$15)
- **Intelligence:** Highest across most tasks

**Perfect for Taskerino because:**
- We're building an agentic system (auto-organizing notes)
- Need high intelligence for topic detection
- Require good reasoning for task extraction
- Q&A needs understanding of context

### Scrolling Behavior

**How it works:**
- **CSS Snap:** `snap-proximity` provides gentle snapping to zone boundaries
- **IntersectionObserver:** Detects which zone is 50%+ visible
- **No Interference:** Zone state updates don't trigger additional scrolling
- **Programmatic Guard:** Button navigation doesn't conflict with observer

**User Experience:**
- Smooth scrolling in all directions
- Natural snap when you stop scrolling
- Navigation arrows and indicators update accurately
- No flickering, jumping, or glitching
- Works perfectly with both manual scroll and button clicks
