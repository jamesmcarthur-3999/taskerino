## Task Dependencies

### Ready to Start (No Dependencies)
- F1: Type System (once approved)

### Waiting on Dependencies
- F2: Storage Layer - Depends on F1
- F3: Migration Service - Depends on F1, F2
- S1: Relationship Manager - Depends on F1, F2, F3
- All other tasks have dependencies (see master plan)

## Notes

- Master plan document created: `/Users/jamesmcarthur/Documents/taskerino/docs/RELATIONSHIP_SYSTEM_MASTER_PLAN.md`
- Documentation emphasizes quality over speed
- Agent validation required for every task
- Backward compatibility is critical requirement
- Real user data must be preserved during migration
