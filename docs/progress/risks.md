## Active Risks

### Risk R1: Data Loss During Migration
- **ID:** R1
- **Category:** Data Risk
- **Likelihood:** Low
- **Impact:** Critical
- **Risk Level:** ðŸŸ  ORANGE
- **Status:** Mitigation in progress

**Description:**
Migration process could fail and corrupt existing relationship data, leading to permanent data loss for users.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Comprehensive backup before migration starts
2. Dry-run mode for validation without changes
3. Rollback mechanism if any errors detected
4. Extensive testing with various data scenarios
5. Progressive rollout (test on sample data first)
6. Pre-migration validation to identify issues
7. Post-migration validation to verify integrity

**Contingency Plan:**
- Manual data recovery procedures documented
- Backup restoration tested and verified
- Support contact information provided to users
- Migration can be deferred if issues found

**Monitoring:**
- Track migration success rate in telemetry
- Monitor for user-reported data issues
- Review validation reports for all test migrations

**Status Updates:**
- 2025-10-24: Task F3 (Migration Service) includes all mitigation measures
- Migration service design reviewed and approved
- Next: Implement and test migration service

- **ID:** R2
- **Category:** Technical Risk
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Risk Level:** ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW
- **Status:** Being monitored

**Description:**
New relationship system could be slower than current implementation, especially with large datasets (>10k relationships), leading to poor user experience.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Performance benchmarks defined upfront (all <100ms)
2. Profiling during development to identify bottlenecks
3. Indexed lookups for O(1) access to relationships
4. Lazy loading where appropriate (don't load until needed)
5. Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
6. Virtual scrolling for long relationship lists in UI

**Performance Targets:**
- Relationship lookup: <5ms
- Add relationship: <10ms
- Remove relationship: <10ms
- Bulk operations (100 items): <100ms
- Modal search (10k items): <100ms
- Sidebar open (50 relationships): <100ms
- Migration (10k entities): <30s

**Contingency Plan:**
- Optimization pass if benchmarks not met
- Can defer non-critical features if needed
- Rollback option if performance unacceptable
- Consider server-side sync for very large datasets

**Monitoring:**
- Run benchmarks after each phase
- Monitor slowest operations
- Track P95/P99 latencies

**Status Updates:**
- 2025-10-24: Benchmarks defined in master plan
- F2 (Storage Layer) includes indexed access for fast lookups
- Next: Implement and benchmark storage layer

### Risk R3: Scope Creep
- **ID:** R3
- **Category:** Schedule Risk
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Risk Level:** ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW
- **Status:** Being monitored

**Description:**
Additional feature requests during implementation could delay completion and expand project scope beyond original plan.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Clear task specifications with fixed scope
2. All tasks approved before work starts
3. Change control process for any additions
4. Phase 2 planned for additional features
5. Prioritization: P0 (must-have), P1 (should-have), P2 (nice-to-have)
6. Regular communication with stakeholder

**Scope Boundaries:**
- **In Scope:** Relationship management, manual UI, AI improvements, migration
- **Out of Scope (Phase 2):** Graph visualization, advanced analytics, export features

**Contingency Plan:**
- Defer non-critical features to Phase 2
- Re-estimate timeline if major changes needed
- Stakeholder approval required for scope changes
- Can cut P2 features if timeline at risk

**Monitoring:**
- Review scope at each phase boundary
- Document all feature requests in decisions log
- Escalate scope changes to stakeholder

**Status Updates:**
- 2025-10-24: Scope clearly defined in master plan
- No scope change requests yet
- Next: Maintain strict scope control during implementation

### Risk R4: Integration Issues
- **ID:** R4
- **Category:** Technical Risk
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Risk Level:** ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW
- **Status:** Being monitored

**Description:**
New components may not integrate smoothly with existing code, causing bugs, regressions, or system instability.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Integration validation after each phase
2. Comprehensive E2E tests covering critical paths
3. Backward compatibility maintained during transition
4. Incremental integration approach (one component at a time)
5. Regression test suite run after each change
6. Code review focuses on integration points

**Integration Points:**
- Storage layer â†” Contexts
- Contexts â†” UI components
- AI services â†” Relationship manager
- Migration service â†” Storage

**Contingency Plan:**
- Dedicated debugging agent if issues arise
- Extended testing phase if needed
- Rollback option for critical issues
- Can isolate problematic components

**Monitoring:**
- Integration tests run after each task
- Track regressions in existing functionality
- Monitor error rates in logs

**Status Updates:**
- 2025-10-24: Integration validation planned for each phase
- Task specifications include integration testing requirements
- Next: Implement Phase 1 with integration tests

### Risk R5: Agent Task Failures
- **ID:** R5
- **Category:** Schedule Risk
- **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Risk Level:** ðŸŸ¢ GREEN
- **Status:** Being monitored

**Description:**
Agent may struggle with complex tasks, misunderstand requirements, or produce low-quality code, requiring rework.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Clear, detailed task specifications with examples
2. Validation gate after each task (separate agent reviews)
3. Orchestrator guidance available if agent stuck
4. Can reassign or break down tasks further if needed
5. Quality standards enforced at validation gate
6. Acceptance criteria must be met before approval

**Contingency Plan:**
- Manual intervention if agent stuck
- Break task into smaller pieces
- Provide additional context/examples
- Reassign to different agent if needed

**Monitoring:**
- Check agent progress every 2 hours (simulated)
- Review validation reports for quality issues
- Track task revision rates

**Status Updates:**
- 2025-10-24: Agent task specifications in progress
