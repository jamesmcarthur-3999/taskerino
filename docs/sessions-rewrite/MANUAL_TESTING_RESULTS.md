## Recommendations

**Based on automated testing:**

1. **Production Ready**: Backend and TypeScript integration are solid
   - All 36 automated tests passing
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Type-safe implementation

2. **Manual Testing Required**: Complete manual testing checklist above before production deployment
   - Verify real-world user experience
   - Test on multiple macOS versions
   - Validate audio quality across different hardware

3. **Known Limitations to Document**:
   - System audio requires macOS 13+ with ScreenCaptureKit
   - USB device hot-swapping may have brief audio gap
   - 5-second grace period for pending audio chunks after stop

4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor in production:
   - Audio buffer usage (should stay <50%)
   - Dropped frames/chunks (should be 0)
   - Memory usage during long sessions
   - File system space consumption
