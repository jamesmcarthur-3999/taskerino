   - Let AI organize it

2. **Review Weekly**
   - Ask Ned: "What topics haven't I updated this week?"
   - Bulk-complete old tasks
   - Clear irrelevant notes

3. **Use Ask Ned Everywhere**
   - See a confusing task? Click "Ask Ned"
   - Forgot context of a note? Click "Ask Ned"
   - Need to prioritize? Ask Ned to help

### Mobile Usage

- Install as PWA (bookmark on home screen)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### AI Not Responding

1. **Check API key**:
   - Profile ‚Üí Verify key is entered correctly
   - Check Anthropic console for credits

2. **Check browser console**:
   - Right-click ‚Üí Inspect ‚Üí Console tab
   - Look for error messages

3. **Clear and retry**:
   - Refresh the page
   - Try a simpler query first

### Tasks Not Extracting

- Make sure **Auto-extract Tasks** is ON in settings
- Use action verbs in your notes: "Need to", "Schedule", "Send", "Follow up"
- Be explicit about timeframes: "by Friday", "next week", "tomorrow"

### Notes Merging Too Aggressively

- Turn **Auto-merge Notes** OFF in settings
- AI will create separate notes instead
- You can manually merge later

### Performance Issues

- Browser localStorage has limits (~5-10MB)
- Export data periodically
- Clear old/irrelevant notes
- Consider clearing completed tasks older than 30 days

### Lost Data

- Data is stored locally in browser
- **Export regularly** as backup
- Clearing browser data will wipe everything
- Private/Incognito mode doesn't persist

## üéâ Getting the Most Out of Taskerino

### Best Practices

1. **Capture First, Organize Never**
   - Trust the AI to file things correctly
   - Don't manually categorize

2. **Talk to Ned Often**
   - Ned is your second brain
   - Use it to recall details, find patterns, spot gaps

3. **Review, Don't Refile**
   - Weekly review of tasks/notes
   - Complete, delete, or defer‚Äîdon't reorganize

4. **Let AI Learn**
   - The more you use it, the smarter it gets
   - Corrections teach the system your preferences

### Common Patterns

**After Meetings:**
```
Meeting with [Person] at [Company]
- Discussed: [topics]
- Decisions made: [outcomes]

```

**Call Notes:**
```
Call with [Person]: [Summary]
Main points:
- [point 1]
- [point 2]
Action items:
- [ ] [task 1]
- [ ] [task 2]
```

**Random Thoughts:**
```
Idea: [what you're thinking]
Context: [why it matters]
Next: [what to do about it]
```
