# Phase 2 JSDoc Additions for types.ts

This file contains all JSDoc comments to be added in Phase 2.

## Task 1: Summary Section Types (15 types)

### 1. AchievementsSection (Line 1284)
```typescript
/**
 * Achievements Section - Notable accomplishments during session
 *
 * Used when AI detects completed work, milestones reached, or goals achieved.
 * Common in deep-work, coding, and building sessions.
 *
 * FIELDS:
 * - achievements: List of accomplishments with timestamps and impact level
 * - summary: Optional overview of all achievements
 *
 * RENDERING:
 * - emphasis: Controls visual prominence (low/medium/high)
 * - position: Order in summary (lower = earlier)
 *
 * @see FlexibleSessionSummary for section system overview
 * @see getSectionByType helper for retrieving sections
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   type: 'achievements',
 *   title: 'Major Wins',
 *   emphasis: 'high',
 *   position: 1,
 *   data: {
 *     achievements: [
 *       {
 *         title: 'Completed OAuth integration',
 *         timestamp: '2025-10-26T14:30:00Z',
 *         screenshotIds: ['abc123'],
 *         impact: 'major'
 *       }
 *     ],
 *     summary: 'Shipped 3 major features today'
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 */
```

### 2. BreakthroughMomentsSection (Line 1297)
```typescript
/**
 * Breakthrough Moments Section - Sudden insights or problem-solving victories
 *
 * Used when AI detects "aha!" moments, debugging breakthroughs, or key realizations.
 * Common in troubleshooting, learning, and exploratory sessions.
 *
 * FIELDS:
 * - moments: Array of breakthrough events with full context
 * - title: Name of the breakthrough
 * - description: What happened
 * - context: Why this was significant
 *
 * RENDERING:
 * - emphasis: Usually 'high' for impactful moments
 * - position: Often early in summary (highlights)
 *
 * @see FlexibleSessionSummary for section system overview
 * @see getSectionByType helper for retrieving sections
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   type: 'breakthrough-moments',
 *   title: 'Key Breakthroughs',
 *   emphasis: 'high',
 *   position: 2,
 *   data: {
 *     moments: [
 *       {
 *         title: 'Found the memory leak',
 *         description: 'Discovered unclosed event listeners in resize handler',
 *         timestamp: '2025-10-26T15:45:00Z',
 *         context: 'After 2 hours of debugging performance issues',
 *         screenshotIds: ['def456']
 *       }
 *     ]
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 */
```

## Task 2: Session-Related Types (7 types)

### 1. SessionScreenshot
```typescript
/**
 * Session Screenshot - Captured screen image with AI analysis
 *
 * Screenshots are automatically captured at intervals (default: 2 min, or adaptive).
 * Each screenshot is analyzed by Claude Vision API to extract:
 * - Activity detection (coding, email, slides, etc.)
 * - OCR text extraction
 * - Context changes (what changed since last screenshot)
 * - Suggested actions (TODOs noticed by AI)
 *
 * STORAGE:
 * - Stored via Content-Addressable Storage (CAS) using attachment hash
 * - attachmentId references deduplicated file in /attachments-ca/
 * - path field is DEPRECATED - use attachmentId instead
 *
 * AI ANALYSIS:
 * - Powered by Sessions Agent (sessionsAgentService.ts)
 * - Adaptive scheduling based on curiosity score (0-1)
 * - Progress tracking (achievements, blockers, insights)
 *
 * @see SessionsAgentService for analysis implementation
 * @see ContentAddressableStorage for storage system
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   id: 'screenshot-123',
 *   sessionId: 'session-456',
 *   timestamp: '2025-10-26T14:30:00Z',
 *   attachmentId: 'att-789',  // ✅ New (CAS reference)
 *   path: '/screenshots/img.png',  // ❌ Deprecated
 *   analysisStatus: 'complete',
 *   aiAnalysis: {
 *     summary: 'Writing authentication logic in VS Code',
 *     detectedActivity: 'coding',
 *     extractedText: 'function validateToken(token: string) {...}',
 *     keyElements: ['VS Code', 'TypeScript', 'auth.ts'],
 *     confidence: 0.95,
 *     curiosity: 0.7,  // High interest - next screenshot sooner
 *     curiosityReason: 'Implementing new feature - want to see progress'
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

```
